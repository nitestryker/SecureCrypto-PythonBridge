## üîê Overview
This repo provides:
- **SecureCrypto.dll** ‚Äî a .NET cryptography library exposing AES, RSA, HMAC, and hashing utilities.
- **securecrypto.py** ‚Äî a Python wrapper that makes the DLL‚Äôs methods accessible as simple Python functions.

Together, these tools give developers a ready-to-use crypto layer for application development without having to re-implement security primitives.

## üí° Implementation Ideas

### 1. Encrypted File Storage
- Encrypt PDFs, images, or backups before uploading to cloud storage.
- Decrypt only on-demand when the user authenticates.
- Use `encrypt_file` / `decrypt_file`.

### 2. Secure Messaging
- Use **Hybrid RSA + AES** to send messages securely:
  - Encrypt with the recipient‚Äôs public key.
  - Decrypt with the recipient‚Äôs private key.
- Verify authenticity with `sign_string` / `verify_string`.

### 3. API Authentication
- Sign requests with HMAC (`hmac`) using a shared secret.
- Verify with `hmac_verify` on the server.
- Prevents tampering and replay attacks.

### 4. Digital Signatures for Documents
- Sign uploaded documents or configuration files with `sign_file_to`.
- Distribute the public key to clients.
- Let clients verify authenticity with `verify_file_from`.

### 5. Integrity Checking
- Use `hash_file` to generate SHA256 or SHA512 digests.
- Store hashes alongside files to detect corruption or tampering.
- Ideal for software distribution pipelines.

### 6. Password-Protected Notes / Data
- Use `encrypt` / `decrypt` for string-level AES.
- Store ciphertext in your database; only decrypt when needed.
- Add HMACs for tamper detection.

### 7. Secure Updates
- Sign update packages with a private key.
- Client apps verify the signature before installation.
- Prevents malicious or altered updates.

### 8. IoT / Edge Device Security
- Lightweight signing and verification for sensor data.
- Hash configs for tamper detection.
- Hybrid encryption for secure command delivery.

## üß∞ Example Workflows

### Encrypted File Sharing
1. Generate a keypair (`generate_keypair`).
2. Encrypt a file with AES (`encrypt_file`).
3. Encrypt the AES key/IV with the recipient‚Äôs RSA public key (`hybrid_encrypt`).
4. Share the `.enc` file and RSA-encrypted key.
5. Recipient decrypts the key with private RSA, then decrypts the file.

### Signed Data Pipeline
1. Server signs data with `sign_file`.
2. Client downloads both data and `.sig` file.
3. Client verifies with `verify_file_from`.
4. Any tampering breaks verification.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes
- Always protect your **private keys** ‚Äî never distribute them.
- Use strong passwords for AES key derivation.
- Favor SHA256/SHA512 over older algorithms.
- HMAC is for shared-secret authentication; RSA signatures are for asymmetric verification.
